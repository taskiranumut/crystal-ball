The v1.0.0 version of the application was developed with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) was used as the bundler, and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the database. _In this version, no coding methodology was used. The application was merely made operational._

_In the next stage, client routing operations will be handled with Vanilla JS._

The aim of this project is to create SPA with Vanilla JS and to examine the processes during the transition of the application created with Vanilla JS to React.js and Next.js. At the same time, the effects of different methodologies are also planned to be analyzed _(work in progress)_.
